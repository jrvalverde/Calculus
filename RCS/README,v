@JR's Numerical Library
======================

This is the start of a Numerical Computing library I began writing long
ago (see the files header comments). It was intended to be rather complete
and generic, and was to include many more computational tasks as well as
literate descriptions of the methods used.

Actually most of the code is already written (on paper) using pesudocode
and all I needed was to write the actual code and verification routines.

As I advanced in my PhD I had less and less time to devote to these
pet projects, and after I started actual working at CSIC (the Spanish
Research Council), I never had time again to work on this.

Most routines come with test code to verify they work as expected, but
you should exercise caution before using them.

I don't know if I will ever have time again for this, not at least while
working at CSIC, that's for sure. So, take it for what it's worth, and if 
you find them useful or extend the library, let me know.

Otherwise, this is place in the Public Domain, and you may freely use them
(you can't claim the copyright nor prevent others from using this code,
though).

I'm adding too several generic packages for manipulation of advanced data 
structures. This code was once submitted for inclusion in an algorithms CD
of which I never heard again, so maybe it's out there.


Have fun,
